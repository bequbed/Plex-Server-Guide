Plex Media Server Secure Access Guide
Overview
This document outlines best practices and considerations for securely managing a Plex Media Server on a Windows-based system, focusing on leveraging Cloudflare Argo Tunnel and evaluating the necessity of VPN routing.

Why Use Cloudflare Argo Tunnel?
The Cloudflare Argo Tunnel provides a secure, reliable way to proxy traffic to your Plex server without exposing your real IP address. It acts as a middleman, ensuring all external access routes through Cloudflare, which:

Masks your public IP address.
Provides TLS encryption for all connections.
Reduces the complexity of managing port forwarding or firewall rules.
Do You Need to Route Plex Through a VPN?
Routing Plex traffic through a VPN is not required if you already have:

Cloudflare Argo Tunnel: Secures external traffic and shields your IP address.
Secure Connections in Plex: Ensures all client connections are encrypted with TLS.
When Routing Through a VPN May Be Useful
Routing Plex through a VPN may be considered in the following cases:

Privacy Concerns with ISP: If you’re concerned about your ISP monitoring or throttling Plex traffic.
No Cloudflare Tunnel: If you prefer to mask your public IP address with a VPN instead of using Cloudflare.
Why It’s Typically Redundant
Cloudflare already handles privacy and encryption.
VPN routing adds unnecessary complexity (port forwarding, split tunneling, firewall adjustments).
Performance can be impacted (e.g., latency and bandwidth overhead).
Recommended Configuration for Secure Plex Access
1. Cloudflare Argo Tunnel
Setup: Follow Cloudflare’s official documentation to create an Argo Tunnel for your Plex server.
Authentication: Optionally restrict access using Cloudflare Access for added security.
Custom Domain: Configure a subdomain (e.g., plex.mydomain.com) for easy access.
2. Plex Settings
Navigate to Settings > Network in the Plex Web App:
Preferred Network Interface: Leave as "Any" unless explicitly required.
LAN Networks: Add your local subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and any additional networks like Tailscale (e.g., 100.64.0.0/10).
Preferred Secure Connections: Ensure this is enabled.
3. VPN Configuration
If you decide to use a VPN:
Use split tunneling to exclude Plex traffic from the VPN.
Configure port forwarding in the VPN to allow remote access.
Adjust firewall and VPN settings to allow LAN/private traffic.
4. Remove VPN Complexity
If using Cloudflare Argo Tunnel:
Remove Plex from VPN routing entirely to avoid conflicts.
Focus on securing the tunnel (e.g., by enforcing authenticated access).
Example Plex Network Configuration
Setting	Value
Preferred Network Interface	Any
LAN Networks	192.168.1.0/24, 100.64.0.0/10
Secure Connections	Preferred
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Plex Not Accessible Externally:
Ensure Cloudflare Argo Tunnel is active and correctly configured.
Verify the custom domain is resolving to the correct tunnel endpoint.
Network Performance Issues:
Avoid routing Plex through the VPN unnecessarily.
Use LAN and private network exceptions in VPN and firewall settings.
Conclusion
For most setups, Cloudflare Argo Tunnel combined with Plex’s built-in secure connection settings offers the best balance of simplicity, performance, and security. Routing Plex through a VPN is optional and usually unnecessary if these tools are configured correctly.
