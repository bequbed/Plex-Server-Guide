Recommended Rclone Mount Settings for mounting a Cloud Drive (OneDrive):

mount encrypted_union: O:  --config "C:\Users\Server\AppData\Roaming\rclone\rclone.conf" --vfs-cache-mode full --vfs-cache-max-size 450G --vfs-read-ahead 2G --vfs-cache-max-age 168h --buffer-size 1G --dir-cache-time 168h --vfs-read-chunk-size 128M --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit off --attr-timeout 5000h --poll-interval 0 --cache-dir G:\Rclone\MountCache --log-level ERROR --log-file="C:\rclone\onedrivemcrypt.txt" --user-agent "ISV|rclone.org|rclone/v1.68.1" --no-checksum --no-modtime --rc --rc-web-gui --rc-addr=127.0.0.1:5572 --rc-user=admin --rc-pass=xxxx

Here’s a breakdown of what each option does and a few minor adjustments to optimisation:

--vfs-cache-mode full: Caches both read and write files, which is ideal for streaming as it helps reduce buffering.
--vfs-cache-max-size 450G: Uses a large cache size (up to 450GB) on your G drive, which should be sufficient for multiple 4K files, preventing frequent re-downloads.
--vfs-read-ahead 2G: Pre-loads up to 2GB ahead in each file for smoother playback.
--vfs-cache-max-age 168h: Keeps cache files for a week, which should work well if you re-watch certain media.
--buffer-size 1G: Allocates a 1GB buffer per file, further reducing any potential for buffering.
--dir-cache-time 168h: Caches directory listings for a week, reducing API calls to the OneDrive server for file information.
--vfs-read-chunk-size 128M: Starts reading files in 128MB chunks, which is suitable for 4K streaming.
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit off: Allows chunks to grow without a cap, improving performance as rclone doesn’t have to restart with smaller chunks.
--attr-timeout 5000h: Caches file attributes for a very long time, reducing metadata requests.
--poll-interval 0: Disables polling, so rclone won’t actively check for file changes (saving API calls).
--no-checksum and --no-modtime: Skips checksum and modification time checks, which improves speed but assumes files won’t change frequently on the server.
--rc and --rc-web-gui: Enables remote control and Web UI for monitoring rclone activity.
--rc-addr=127.0.0.1:5572: Sets up the remote control interface on localhost at port 5572.
--cache-dir G:\Rclone\MountCache: Directs the cache to your external SSD (G drive).
Minor Adjustments for Enhanced Performance and Stability:
Adjust --poll-interval:
Setting --poll-interval 0 disables rclone’s ability to detect server-side changes automatically. If you need occasional updates, consider setting this to 15s or 30s instead of 0. This way, you can still benefit from updates without a constant API load.
Consider Monitoring for SSD Health:
Since your cache directory is on the external SSD, keep an eye on its health with tools like Samsung Magician to track wear, temperature, and performance.
