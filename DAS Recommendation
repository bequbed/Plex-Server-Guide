### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of DAS Options for Beelink MINI-S12 Plex Server Use

This section provides a comprehensive evaluation of Direct Attached Storage (DAS) options from TerraMaster for use with the Beelink MINI-S12 PC, focusing on compatibility with its USB-A ports and pricing in the Netherlands. The analysis considers storage capacity, performance, and connectivity, ensuring suitability for a Plex media server setup. The current time is 11:49 PM PDT on Monday, March 24, 2025, and all data reflects the most recent information available.

#### Device Context and Storage Needs
The Beelink MINI-S12, equipped with an Intel N100 processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and a 500GB M.2 NVMe SSD, is designed for low-power, 24/7 operation as a Plex server, capable of supporting 3 simultaneous transcodes with hardware acceleration via Intel Quick Sync Video. For a media server, significant storage is critical, as users typically require large capacity for video files, especially in 4K resolution. The internal SSD is insufficient for large libraries, necessitating external storage via DAS, which connects directly to the PC via USB, ensuring fast local access without network bottlenecks. Given the user’s note that the PC does not have a USB-C connection, it has USB-A ports, specifically 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A and 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, as per the specifications.

#### TerraMaster DAS Options and Compatibility
TerraMaster, a Chinese company specializing in storage solutions, offers several DAS products under their Home/SOHO DAS category, suitable for direct connection to the Beelink PC. Key models include:

- **D6-320**: A 6-bay USB3.2 Gen2 10Gbps external hard drive enclosure, supporting up to 6 SATA drives (3.5-inch HDDs, 2.5-inch HDDs, or SSDs), with a maximum raw capacity of 132TB (22TB per drive x 6). It offers read/write speeds up to 1,016MB/s when fully populated with WD Red 8TB HDDs, and 510MB/s read with a single WD Red 1TB SSD. It has a USB-C port but comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable, ensuring compatibility with the PC’s USB-A ports. Reviews highlight its robustness and suitability for media storage, with a retail price around €330 on [Amazon Netherlands](https://www.amazon.nl/TERRAMASTER-D6-320-Externe-Schijf-Behuizing/dp/B0BZC3HCNC).

- **D5-300C**: A 5-bay USB3.1 Gen1 5Gbps enclosure, offering similar connectivity but with one less bay, reducing maximum capacity to 110TB. It also has a USB-C port and comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable, priced around €300 on [Amazon Netherlands](https://www.amazon.nl/TERRAMASTER-D5-300C-RAID-behuizing-Ondersteuning-RAID-opslag/dp/B071S6ZCMM). It’s suitable for users with slightly smaller storage needs, with speeds up to 235MB/s in RAID 0 configurations.

- **D4-300**: A 4-bay USB3.1 Gen1 enclosure, with a maximum capacity of 88TB, and speeds up to 410MB/s in some setups, priced around €180 on [Amazon Netherlands](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/TerraMaster-D4-300-External-Enclosure-Swappable/dp/B08CN4Z4PC). It also includes a USB-A to USB-C cable, ideal for compact setups but less capacity for extensive media libraries.

Given the user’s likely need for large storage for a Plex server, the D6-320 stands out for its higher bay count and faster interface, aligning with the need for high-speed access to media files. All models are compatible with the PC’s USB-A ports via the included USB-A to USB-C cables, ensuring no additional purchase is needed for connectivity.

#### Performance and Connectivity Considerations
The Beelink MINI-S12 has USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A ports, supporting up to 10 Gbps, and the D6-320’s USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C port matches this speed, ensuring full performance via the included cable. The D5-300C and D4-300, with USB 3.1 Gen1, support 5 Gbps, which is sufficient for many use cases but slower than the D6-320. Reviews, such as those on TechRadar, praise the D6-320 for its quiet operation and heat dissipation, crucial for 24/7 server use, with actual read/write speeds confirmed at 1,016MB/s under optimal conditions ([TerraMaster D6-320 Review](https://www.techradar.com/pro/terramaster-d6-320-6-bay-review)).

An unexpected detail is that all TerraMaster DAS models include a USB-A to USB-C cable, simplifying setup and ensuring compatibility without extra costs, which is particularly convenient for users upgrading their storage without additional purchases.

#### Pricing in the Netherlands
Based on recent web searches, the approximate prices in the Netherlands are:
- D6-320: €330
- D5-300C: €300
- D4-300: €180

These prices are sourced from [Amazon Netherlands](https://www.amazon.nl/) and may vary depending on availability, discounts, or retailer policies. It’s advisable for the user to check current prices on the retailer’s website before purchasing, as prices can fluctuate, especially given the current date of March 24, 2025.

#### Comparative Context and Alternatives
While the user requested TerraMaster options, it’s worth noting that other manufacturers like QNAP offer DAS with USB-A ports directly, such as the QNAP TR-004, a 4-bay USB3.2 Gen1 DAS with hardware RAID, supporting up to 88TB and speeds around 227MB/s download, 199MB/s upload. However, given the user’s focus on TerraMaster, the D6-320 remains the top choice for its capacity and speed, especially with the included cable ensuring compatibility.

#### Summary Table: Key Metrics for TerraMaster DAS Options
Below is a table summarizing the key metrics for the recommended TerraMaster DAS options, aiding in comparison:

| **Model**   | **Bays** | **Interface**   | **Max Capacity (TB)** | **Max Speed (MB/s)** | **Price (EUR)** | **Cable Included**       |
