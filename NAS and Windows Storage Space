Unified Storage Solution: NAS Drives with StableBit CloudDrive and Windows Storage Spaces
This guide describes how I combined two NAS drives into a single virtual drive visible on Windows 11. The solution uses StableBit CloudDrive to convert NAS shares into local drives and Windows Storage Spaces to create a unified storage pool. This setup is scalable, non-destructive, and integrates seamlessly with Windows.

Overview
The goal was to:

Combine two NAS drives (each 18TB) into a single virtual drive.
Preserve the data on the existing drive without reformatting.
Ensure the combined drive is visible and usable in Windows for applications like Plex and qBittorrent.
The chosen solution:

StableBit CloudDrive: Virtualizes NAS shares into local drives that are compatible with Windows tools.
Windows Storage Spaces: Combines the local drives into a single virtual volume.
Benefits
Non-Destructive: Existing data is preserved.
Scalable: Easily add more NAS drives in the future.
Windows Integration: The final virtual drive works natively with Windows, including applications like Plex and torrent clients.
Setup Instructions
Step 1: Configure StableBit CloudDrive
Download and Install StableBit CloudDrive:

StableBit CloudDrive provides a user-friendly GUI to create virtual drives.
Install and open the software on your Windows machine.
Add NAS Drives to StableBit CloudDrive:

Navigate to Add New Drive in CloudDrive.
Select the File Share provider.
For the NAS shares:
Add \\192.168.1.29\nas4 for the first drive.
Add \\192.168.1.29\nas-35 for the second drive.
Assign a drive letter to each virtual drive created by CloudDrive (e.g., L: for nas4 and M: for nas-35).
Verify Drive Creation:

Ensure both NAS shares are now visible as local drives in File Explorer.
Step 2: Create a Storage Pool Using Windows Storage Spaces
Open Windows Storage Spaces:

Go to Control Panel → System and Security → Storage Spaces.
Select Create a new pool and storage space.
Add the Virtual Drives:

Select the virtual drives created by StableBit CloudDrive (L: and M:).
These drives should appear as available drives in the Storage Spaces interface.
Choose Pool Settings:

For the storage layout, choose:
Simple (No Redundancy): Combines the drives into one logical volume with full capacity (36TB total in this case).
Configure the pool size (e.g., 36TB).
Click Create Pool.
Initialize and Format the Pool:

Assign a drive letter to the storage space (e.g., X:).
Format it as NTFS.
Step 3: Verify and Use the Unified Drive
Open File Explorer to ensure the new virtual drive (X:) is visible.
Use this unified drive for:
Plex: Point your Plex Media Server to X: for media storage.
qBittorrent: Use X: as the default download directory.
How It Works
StableBit CloudDrive
Purpose: Converts network shares (NAS drives) into local drives that Windows recognizes.
Process: Maps the NAS shares (\\192.168.1.29\nas4 and \\192.168.1.29\nas-35) as virtual local drives (e.g., L: and M:).
Windows Storage Spaces
Purpose: Combines multiple drives into a single virtual volume.
Process:
Takes the virtual drives created by StableBit CloudDrive.
Creates a single storage pool (X:) using a "Simple (No Redundancy)" layout for maximum capacity.
Scalability
To add more drives:

Add the new NAS drive in StableBit CloudDrive.
Add the new virtual drive to the existing Storage Pool in Windows Storage Spaces.
Performance Considerations
Network Speed:

Ensure your NAS and Windows machine are connected via a high-speed gigabit or 10GbE network to avoid bottlenecks.
Plex and Streaming:

Plex may scan large libraries stored on the unified drive, so optimize your Plex server for metadata caching and indexing.
Backup Strategy:

This setup does not provide redundancy. Regularly back up critical data to another location (e.g., external drives or cloud storage).
Troubleshooting
Virtual Drives Not Detected in Storage Spaces:

Ensure StableBit CloudDrive is running and that the drives are mounted as local drives.
Restart the Storage Spaces service or reboot your system.
Performance Issues:

Check network bandwidth and disk health on your NAS.
Optimize StableBit CloudDrive’s cache settings for better performance.
Data Loss Risk:

Before modifying any drives, always back up your data to avoid accidental data loss.
Future Improvements
Explore RAID or parity configurations in Storage Spaces for redundancy.
Consider migrating to a hardware RAID solution if redundancy is a priority.
Monitor performance and consider upgrading to a faster NAS or storage solution if needed.
