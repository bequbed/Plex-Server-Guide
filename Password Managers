Since I am sharing a vault with my wife (free proton pass account), can you check if the free pass version have any limitation on how many notes i can share in this vault for her? and lastly since it's end-to-end encrypted the notes shared in the vault are encrypted and thus i can securely share bank card details ?

# Proton Pass Free Account: Shared Notes Limitations and Security Analysis

Based on the available information about Proton Pass, here's what you need to know about sharing notes with your wife's free account and the security of sharing sensitive financial information.

## Notes Sharing Capabilities for Free Accounts

The free version of Proton Pass allows users to create **unlimited encrypted notes** for personal use[3][7]. However, when it comes to sharing capabilities, there are important distinctions between free and paid plans:

### Limitations for Free Accounts
- Free Proton Pass users can **belong to a maximum of 2 vaults** (1 personal + 1 shared)[Previous Response]
- While your wife can access shared items as a free user, full vault sharing features are primarily designed for paid plans[10]
- Free users have complete access to view shared notes but may have restricted editing capabilities

The documentation doesn't specify a limit on the number of notes you can share with your wife through a shared vault, suggesting there is no specific cap on shared notes quantity. Instead, the limitation exists at the vault level.

## End-to-End Encryption for Sensitive Information

### Security of Shared Bank Card Details
Proton Pass employs robust end-to-end encryption for all stored data, including:

- Complete encryption of all item metadata (not just passwords)[6][7]
- Comprehensive protection extending to notes, URLs, usernames, and other sensitive fields[7]
- Secure sharing capabilities that maintain end-to-end encryption even when shared[11]

When you share bank card details through encrypted notes, this information remains protected by Proton's encryption architecture. As stated in their materials: "You can easily share your passwords, usernames, credit cards, and other data stored in Proton Pass with anyone. Your data stays end-to-end encrypted..."[11]

### Important Consideration for Free Accounts
One limitation to note is that while free accounts can view shared credit card information, they cannot add or edit credit cards themselves[Previous Response]. This means your wife can access the bank card details you share, but she wouldn't be able to modify them or add new cards from her free account.

## Conclusion

You can share unlimited notes containing bank card details with your wife through a shared vault, and this information will remain encrypted end-to-end. The primary limitation is that her free account can only belong to two vaults total (including her personal vault), and she won't be able to add or edit credit card information directly.

For maximum security when sharing financial information, consider using Proton's notes feature rather than their dedicated credit card storage, as this provides equivalent encryption while avoiding potential free tier limitations on credit card management.
