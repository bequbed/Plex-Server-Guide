To enhance privacy and security on your Windows-based Plex media server, here are several essential privacy-oriented concepts and tools you should explore and potentially implement:

1. Firewall Rules and Network Segmentation

Windows Firewall Configuration: Set up custom inbound and outbound rules to control which applications can access your network and internet.

Network Segmentation: If possible, create a separate VLAN for your media server to isolate it from other devices on your network. This reduces exposure and limits access to sensitive data.


2. Local DNS Filtering and Ad-blocking

Pi-hole: Consider running Pi-hole as a network-level ad-blocker to filter unwanted requests and trackers. This can be paired with your Plex server to reduce tracking scripts and telemetry.

Encrypted DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS): Continue using ControlD or similar services to encrypt and filter DNS queries. Tools like YogaDNS can enforce DNS rules and ensure all DNS requests are securely routed.


3. TLS/SSL Certificates for Secure Connections

HTTPS for Plex: Configure Plex to use HTTPS for secure connections between your server and clients. This can be achieved by enabling secure connections in Plex settings or using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik with a TLS certificate (e.g., from Let's Encrypt).

Cloudflare Tunnel: If you use a Cloudflare Tunnel for remote access, ensure it is set up correctly with SSL/TLS encryption for additional security.


4. Regular Software and System Updates

Keep Plex and Windows Updated: Ensure Plex Media Server, Windows, and any other software (e.g., media codecs, network tools) are kept up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.

Automated Updates: Enable automatic updates for critical software and perform regular checks for pending updates.


5. VPN Configuration

Secure VPN Configuration: If your goal is to maintain privacy for media access and torrenting, configure your VPN client carefully. Use split tunneling to route Plex traffic separately or ensure your entire server is behind the VPN as necessary.

Static Port Forwarding: If using a VPN like AirVPN, take advantage of static port forwarding for consistent remote Plex access.


6. Use a Reverse Proxy

Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy: Setting up a reverse proxy can enhance security by hiding your Plex server's real IP address, adding SSL/TLS encryption, and allowing for access control lists (ACLs).

Access Restrictions: Configure rules to allow or deny access based on IP, geographic location, or authentication requirements.


7. Disable or Restrict Remote Access (If Not Needed)

If you donâ€™t require remote access to your Plex server, consider disabling it to reduce potential attack vectors.

Alternatively, use services like Tailscale to create a private VPN mesh network for secure, authenticated remote access.


8. Harden Windows Security Settings

Account Control: Use a non-administrative account for day-to-day tasks on your Plex server and enable User Account Control (UAC) for sensitive operations.

Windows Defender and Anti-Malware Software: Ensure Windows Defender or a reputable third-party anti-malware solution is active and regularly scans your system.


9. Local Encryption for Sensitive Media Files

If you store sensitive or private media, consider encrypting these files locally using tools like VeraCrypt.

This ensures media is only accessible when mounted by an authorized user.


10. Logging and Monitoring

Monitor Network Traffic: Use tools like Wireshark or GlassWire to monitor network activity and detect any unusual or unauthorized access attempts.

Audit Plex Logs: Periodically review Plex server logs for any unauthorized access attempts or strange behavior.


11. Use Strong Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): If available, enable 2FA on your Plex account for added security.

Secure Passwords: Use a unique, strong password for your Plex Media Server and avoid reusing passwords across multiple services.


12. Consider Blocking UPnP

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) can be a security risk, as it automatically opens network ports without your explicit consent. Disable it on your router and manually configure port forwarding if necessary.


13. Disable or Restrict Telemetry (If Possible)

Review the settings of Plex and other installed software to minimize telemetry data collection and reporting where possible.


By implementing these measures, you can significantly enhance the privacy and security of your Windows-based Plex media server, safeguarding your media activities from unauthorized access and improving data protection overall.
